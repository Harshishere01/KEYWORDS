 # OPERATING SYSTEMS
 
The **OS (Operating System)** manages hardware and software resources, creating a bridge between the two. Components include:
- **Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages system resources.
- **OS Layer**: Abstracts hardware resources for higher-level software.
- **Applications**: Programs that run on top of the OS.
- **CISC & RISC**: Two primary CPU instruction set architectures.
- **Virtual Machine**: An emulation of a computer system.

 # OSI LAYERS
 There are 7 layers in osi

 # NETWORK 
 There are 2 types of network -                      
 1. INTERNET (WAN - wide area network) - public network
 2. INTRANET (LAN - local area network) - private network

# NETWORKING 
Networking connects devices and system allowing them to communicate and share data.                    
KEY COMPONENTS -

# BAREMETAL
Bare metal refers to a physical computer server that's dedicated to a single user, or tenant. It can also refer to a computer's hard disk, or a virtualization environment that runs without a host operating system.

# EHTERNET 
Ethernet is a wired computer networking technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), or wide area network (WAN).

# VIRTUAL MACHINE 
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that functions like a physical computer, but exists within another computer's operating system. In cloud computing, VMs are used to virtualize the resources of cloud service providers' servers. This allows multiple customers to share resources, which is known as multi-tenant cloud architecture.
 ## VIRTUALISATION AND CLOUD 
 Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware, facilitated by a hypervisor. The cloud enables on-demand availability of computing resources.

 # BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRCIES
 Blockchain technology records and confirms cryptocurrency trades, like a digital ledger. It collects and stores information about buying, selling, or exchanging digital assets. This information exists without a central authority (such as a bank) overseeing or controlling the cryptocurrency market.

# PROGRAMING AND DEVELOPMENT 
## COMPILER 
Converts high-level code into machine code. Interpreter: Executes code line by line. Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data efficiently. DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms): Crucial for performance optimization in software development.

## OPEN SOURCE 
Open source refers to software whose source code is made available to the public for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. This model promotes collaboration and transparency, allowing a community of developers and users to contribute to the software’s development and improvement.

## CLOSE SOURCE 
Closed source software, also known as proprietary software, is software whose source code is not made available to the public. Instead, the source code is kept secret by the software's developers or the company that owns it. Users are granted access to the software through licenses but do not have the ability to view, modify, or distribute the source code.

## VPN 
Virtual Private Network, is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network, enhancing security and privacy.

# RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). It was designed to be a simple, modular, and extensible ISA, making it a versatile and adaptable choice for a wide range of computing applications.

# CISC 
CISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that aims to reduce the number of instructions needed to perform a task by providing a large set of complex instructions. CISC architectures are designed to execute multi-step operations with a single instruction, which can help simplify programming and reduce the number of instructions per program.

## DATA STRUCTURES 
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, managing, and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

# DBMS
DBMS stands for Database Management System, which is a software system that provides an interface for interacting with databases. A DBMS manages and organizes data, supports data manipulation and retrieval, and ensures data integrity and security. It serves as a bridge between users and the database, handling data storage, queries, updates, and administration.

# LINKER / LOADER 
Linker is a software tool that combines multiple object files generated by a compiler into a single executable file. It resolves references between object files and ensures that all code and data are properly connected. Here’s how it works:

# SEMICONDUCTORS 
Semiconductor chips (also known as integrated circuits or ICs) are crucial components in modern electronics. They consist of multiple semiconductor devices (such as transistors, diodes, and resistors) integrated onto a single piece of semiconductor material, typically silicon. These chips are used in a wide variety of applications, from simple gadgets to complex computing systems.



 # FULLSTACKS                                                     
 Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end.

 1. FRONTEND - In frontend we develop websites and web applications.

 FRONTEND LANGUAGES -                                                                                                                                                                       1. HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)                                              
                      2. CSS (CASCARDING STYLE SHEETS) - stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or JAVA SCRPIT.                                                                                                    3. JAVA SCRIPT                                            
                      
 2. BACKEND - It refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user.

 BACKEND LANGUAGES - 1. PYTHON    
                     2. JAVA - SPRINGBOOT
