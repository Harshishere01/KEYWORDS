 # OPERATING SYSTEMS
 
The **OS (Operating System)** manages hardware and software resources, creating a bridge between the two. Components include:
- **Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages system resources.
- **OS Layer**: Abstracts hardware resources for higher-level software.
- **Applications**: Programs that run on top of the OS.
- **CISC & RISC**: Two primary CPU instruction set architectures.
- **Virtual Machine**: An emulation of a computer system.

 # OSI LAYERS
 There are 7 layers in osi

 # FULLSTACKS                                                     
 Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end.

 1. FRONTEND - In frontend we develop websites and web applications.

 FRONTEND LANGUAGES -                                                                                                                                                                       1. HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)                                              
                      2. CSS (CASCARDING STYLE SHEETS) - stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or JAVA SCRPIT.                                                                                                    3.

 2. BACKEND - It refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user.

 BACKEND LANGUAGES - 1. PYTHON    
                     2. JAVA - SPRINGBOOT    
                     3. FRAMEWORK - PYTHON - DJango , FLASK
